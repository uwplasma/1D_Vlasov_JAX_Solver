.. py:function:: solver_ode(k, t_span, m_max, v_e, nu, q, objective)

   Solves a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) using the specified
   objective function and problem parameters. The solver integrates the system from
   a given initial state over a specified time span. It employs a Dopri5 solver with
   a PID-based step size controller to achieve precise numerical results.

   :param k: Parameter to be passed as an argument to the ODE system.
   :type k: Array-like
   :param t_span: Time span over which the ODEs are solved. It must be a sequence
       containing the initial and final times of integration.
   :type t_span: Sequence[float]
   :param m_max: The maximum length used to initialize the state vector for the ODE
       problem.
   :type m_max: int
   :param v_e: Additional argument to be passed into the objective function.
   :type v_e: float
   :param nu: Additional argument to be passed into the objective function.
   :type nu: float
   :param q: Additional argument to be passed into the objective function.
   :type q: Array-like
   :param objective: The objective function defining the ODE system. It represents
       the time derivative of the state vector.
   :type objective: Callable
   :return: The solution of the ODE system, which includes the time-evaluated state
       vector at specified save points.
   :rtype: Array-like
